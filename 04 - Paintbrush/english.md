using mouseY and mouseX variables to decide where to put Mr. Fatty.

Remove "painting" the background so Mr. Fatty paints on top of himself again and again, and we are painting!!!

(in video show Mr. Fatty getting smacked on top of himself again and agian, layering shapes in Descript Editor, "but if we paint the background it covers all the previous Mr. Flappy birds)

How "painting" actually works:
If your interested in the more technical reason of how shapes are drawn "on top of eachother"

> Basically the canvas is just a bunch of pixels.
> When we draw a shape we update the pixels in that spot. So we aren't really drawing mahy shapes on top of eachother (even though it looks like that), instead we are overwriting the colors of pixels that might have been a Mr. Fatty.
